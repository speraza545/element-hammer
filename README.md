# Application Info
This application is the starting phases of a dice rolling application that will allow people to create armies based off of factions very much like warhammer40k. It is meant to be used in conjuction with a tabletop game such as that. What this will ultimately do is handle battle logic so that the game becomes more accessible to new players, who may have a hard time remembering all the rules or unit stats. Due to copy right reasons, I am using my own factions and stats as a starting point.

2) CD to the application file and run bundle install
3) Start the server by typing   rails s   into the terminal
